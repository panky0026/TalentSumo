1. **You**: We need to create a platform that can be used to store notes. Notes can be textual, audio or
video. Also the system can have many users who can share notes amongst them.
Create functional REST apis for such a system. The database can be sqlite for testing the api
functionality.
The major functionality we want to build is to store the notes and query the stored notes.
Optional: sharing the notes amongst the users
Clean code and creativity are a great way to leave a good impression.  i  django
2. **ChatGPT**: To achieve this functionality, here are some functional REST APIs using Django:

1. API for creating a new note:
```
POST /api/notes/
Request body:
{
  "title": "My note",
  "content_type": "text",
  "content": "This is my note"
}
Response:
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "My note",
  "content_type": "text",
  "content": "This is my note"
}
```

2. API for getting a specific note:
```
GET /api/notes/<note_id>/
Response:
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "My note",
  "content_type": "text",
  "content": "This is my note"
}
```

3. API for getting all notes:
```
GET /api/notes/
Response:
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "My note",
    "content_type": "text",
    "content": "This is my note"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "title": "My audio note",
    "content_type": "audio",
    "content": "https://my-audio-note.mp3"
  },
  {
    "id": 3,
    "title": "My video note",
    "content_type": "video",
    "content": "https://my-video-note.mp4"
  }
]
```

4. API for updating a note:
```
PUT /api/notes/<note_id>/
Request body:
{
  "title": "New note title",
  "content": "This is my updated note"
}
Response:
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "New note title",
  "content_type": "text",
  "content": "This is my updated note"
}
```

5. API for deleting a note:
```
DELETE /api/notes/<note_id>/
Response:
204 No Content
```

6. API for creating a new user:
```
POST /api/users/
Request body:
{
  "username": "myusername",
  "password": "mypassword"
}
Response:
{
  "id": 1,
  "username": "myusername"
}
```

7. API for getting a specific user:
```
GET /api/users/<user_id>/
Response:
{
  "id": 1,
  "username": "myusername"
}
```

8. API for getting all users:
```
GET /api/users/
Response:
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "username": "myusername"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "username": "anotheruser"
  }
]
```

9. API for sharing a note with a user:
```
POST /api/notes/<note_id>/share/
Request body:
{
  "user_id": 2
}
Response:
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "My note",
  "content_type": "text",
  "content": "This is my note",
  "shared_with": [2]
}
```

10. API for getting notes shared with a user:
```
GET /api/notes/shared/?user_id=2
Response:
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "My note",
    "content_type": "text",
    "content": "This is my note",
    "shared_by": 1
  }
]
```

These APIs should provide the functionality to store notes, query them and share them amongst users. You can use SQLite to test these APIs.
